| Model             |   MAE   |     MSE    |   RMSE   |  RÂ²   |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| Linear Regression | 1684.08 | 5363530.52 | 2315.93  | 0.700 |
| Random Forest     | 1124.68 | 3613562.53 | 1900.94  | 0.798 |
| GPT-4o-mini       | 1671.45 | 6693850.15 | 2587.25  | 0.630 |


Although the GPT-4o Mini demonstrates lower predictive accuracy based on the metrics, it is important to note that this evaluation was conducted using only **400 training data points**, whereas traditional ML methods were trained on more than 8,000 data points.
